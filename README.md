# MVF_Version2
MVF (modal based vector fitting) is an analytical method for coupling matrix extraction of microwave filters. Version 2 modifies the code to make it faster and more reasonable. 

Please run the code in MATLAB newer than R2018b.
1. Run MVF_main.m;
2. Import simulated/measured S-parameters as data files in .s2p format;
3. Output the extracted coupling matrix representing the equivalent circuit.
